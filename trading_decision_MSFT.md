The risk management report recommends a position size of 20.41 shares, with a stop-loss price level at $485, and a risk-reward ratio of 2:1. The portfolio allocation recommendation suggests an allocation percentage of 5% of the total portfolio, which is expected to increase the overall volatility of the portfolio but also provide a unique exposure to the technology sector.
